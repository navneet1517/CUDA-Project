🚀 CUDA Matrix Multiplication

This project demonstrates parallelized matrix multiplication using NVIDIA CUDA and compares it with a CPU-based implementation to highlight the performance gains from GPU acceleration.

📌 Project Overview

Matrix multiplication is a computationally intensive operation, and this project showcases how CUDA can significantly speed up the process by leveraging GPU parallelism. The implementation includes:

CPU Version: Sequential matrix multiplication for baseline comparison.

GPU Version: CUDA kernel-based parallel matrix multiplication.

Performance Metrics: Execution time comparison between CPU and GPU.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: C++

Parallel Computing: CUDA (NVIDIA GPU)

Development Environment: NVCC Compiler

Tools:

cudaEvent_t for GPU execution timing

Standard C++ clock() for CPU timing

⚙️ How It Works

Data Setup: Two NxN matrices are initialized with constant values.

Memory Allocation: Allocates host memory (CPU) & device memory (GPU), copies data to GPU.

CUDA Kernel Execution: Each thread computes one element of the result matrix using a 2D grid of blocks.

Timing: Measures execution time for GPU kernel using CUDA Events and compares with CPU execution time.

Result Copy Back & Cleanup: Transfers the computed matrix back to host memory and frees resources.

📊 Sample Output
GPU execution time: 12.34 ms
CPU execution time: 945.67 ms


This demonstrates the significant speedup achieved using CUDA.

📈 Optimizations Considered

Thread Blocking: Uses 16x16 thread block size for better GPU occupancy.

Memory Coalescing: Row-major order ensures coalesced memory access.

Scalability: Works for any NxN matrix (adjustable via #define N).
